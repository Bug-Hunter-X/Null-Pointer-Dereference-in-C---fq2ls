This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  Null pointer dereferences are a frequent source of crashes and unpredictable behavior in C++ programs.  Always check for null before dereferencing a pointer.
